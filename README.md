# Face Recognition-Based Attendance Management System
This is a Capstone Project of IIT Patna for Sem-2 students.
In this project, we are designing a Face Recognition based Attendance management system, which can be implemented in Schools and Colleges.
This project is based on Python. We have used Tkinter to create the UI of this application, OpenCV to use the camera, etc.
